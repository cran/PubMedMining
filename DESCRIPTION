Description: Easy function for text-mining the 'PubMed' repository based on defined sets of terms.
    The relationship between fix-terms (related to your research topic) and pub-terms (terms which pivot around your research focus)
    is calculated using the pointwise mutual information algorithm ('PMI'). Church, Kenneth Ward and Hanks, Patrick (1990) <https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J90-1003/>
    A text file is generated with the 'PMI'-scores for each fix-term. Then for each collocation pairs (a fix-term + a pub-term),
    a text file is generated with related article titles and publishing years. Additional Author section will follow in the next version updates.
